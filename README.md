## Rocon Rosjava Core

These are the rocon rosjava libraries. They provide important interfaces for working
with various rocon components and some commonly used rosjava patterns (e.g. more convenient listeners).

## Deprecating

Deprecated for **ROS Kinetic** due to lack of resources. Feel free to pick up some of the code if it's useful.
